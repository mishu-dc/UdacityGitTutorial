Hello world!!!

With history we can quickly find if a bug was introduced because of a recent change.
We can find in which version a bug or feature was introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-Pros: More flexible
      Less chance of getting un compilable code
      
-Cons: Depends on the developer to commit properly There is a chance that developer forgot to commit and the changes are lost forever.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-user git log to see the history. then user git diff to compare two version.
