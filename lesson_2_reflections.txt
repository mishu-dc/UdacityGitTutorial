Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Ans: a hidden .git directory is created which contains git meta data.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Ans: staging area contains all the files which we have added in git. If we commit all the changes from staging area will go to repository.
	Working directory contains all the files which we may not add in staging area and/or git repository.
	We can keep adding files in staging area and do a final commit.
